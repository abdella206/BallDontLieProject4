## Introduction

Balling is a web app to search for your favorite NBA Players save them and view stats for any year they have played, built on the MERN stack.


### Project Specification

This is Portfolio Project 4 of General Assembly Web Development Immersive. The goal is to create a Full-Stack Web App of our chosing. We have the freedom to chose technologies we are comfortable with, or challenge ourselves to learn new things. I chose the technologies I was comfortable with that way I can get better at it.

### Technical Requirements

- Use Mongodb to build an application backend
- Create an application using at least 2 related models, one of which should be a user
- Include all major CRUD functions for all of those models
- Add authentication/authorization to restrict access to appropriate users
- Layout and style my front-end with clean & well-formatted CSS, with a framework.
- Deploy your application online so it's publicly accessible

## Building the App
During the initial ideation of the project, I wanted to create a platform where users can search for their favorite players add them to their favorite players list and get the season average for any year that they played in the NBA. 

### Future Implementation
In the near future, I will be adding more styling and making the content a bit cleaner and better. 

I'm hoping to also add a favorite team feature so users can stay updated with their fvorite team stats, latest games socres and standings.

I am happy with the way the app followed the prototype design specs and I will continue to build on that. With a few more features and CSS clean up, I'm confident that Kause will be one of the most useful and creative event creatation application out there!
